Type "make" to compile, "./cardThrowSort" to run the simulation. With the values I have
currently set it should run on lists sized 5-20, with 5 lists for each value of n. If any sort
takes 30 minutes it will cancel that sort, but the time it took will still be used in
calculating the average time.

Possible improvement: Calculating the average time it takes to sort everything. I'd add
that now but I really want dinner so I'm gonna go get that now.

Side note, GitHub was wayyyy easier this time. Slowing down and thinking more +
referencing my notes + my experience from yesterday helped with that.
